Hi everyone,

This is the first and exclusive version of ChatGPT HTML Client 2.0.
Whenever you've got OpenAi available api key you can just use it with this pure html + vanilla js client.

Highlight features:
* Chats history window ;)
* Ability to copy content to the clipboard or download.
* Mobile version !

USAGE:
Look for the apiKey definition (YOUR-API-KEY-HERE), and replace the string with your real apiKey.
The current AI model is "gpt-o4", depends on your openAi api settings, you can change it to any other model.

You are mostly welcomed to modify this code and create your own version.

Enjoy !
